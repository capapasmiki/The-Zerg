				"By spending 1 minute digging, the baneling can burrow through solid rock up to 5 feet below the surface, leaving no trace above, and completely submerging itself. While burrowed, the baneling has total cover, can't move, and can't take actions other than to suicide, or to unburrow as a bonus action. If the baneling takes 10 or more damage while burrowed, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken, or be forced to unburrow as a reaction."

The explosion leaves behind a pool of acid with a radius of 5 feet, centered on the baneling. This area is difficult terrain, a creature that ends its turn in the pool of acid take 7 ({@damage 2d6}) acid damage. The pool of acid dilutes and vanishes after 1 round."
